# Templates

This repository contains a list of the various HTML templates we provide as
both examples in our [blog posts](https://blog.pdftoolkitapi.com) and 
[API documentation](https://docs.pdftoolkitapi.com) as well as more specific
templates used to generate PDF documents such as invoices, resumes, etc.

The repository is divided as follows:
- A directory `tutorials` containing the HTML templates and other various
code samples used within our blog posts and tutorials

- Other specific directory containing their corresponding templates (for 
instance, the directory `invoices` logically contains invoices HTML templates
used for generating PDF invoices)
